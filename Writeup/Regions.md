# Major Regions

## Description

* Region: Major Region
* Subregion: Mountain Region / Parent Mountain Range
* Land Mass Type: Mountain / Mountain Range / Stand Alone
	- Mountain: One land mass containing multiple hills (Munro/Corbett) and tops. To be included in a mountain, Munros, Corbetts, tops and cairns must be present before any contour declines to under 600m
	- Mountain Range: Range of land masses containing multiple hills (Munro/Corbett) and tops. To be included in a mountain range, Munros, Corbetts, tops and cairns must be present before any contour declines to under 400m
	- Stand Alone: One land mass containing one hill (Munro/Corbett) but unlimited tops. Stand Alones with only a top or a carin marking their summit (not a Munro/Corbett) are not included
* Hill Type: Munro / Munro Top / Corbett / Corbett Top / Graham / Cairn
	- Munro: Munro
	- Munro Top: A peak, perhaps marked by a cairn or trig point, which sits at the height of a munro. Must be present at a maximum stationery point
	- Corbett: Corbett
	- Corbett Top: A peak, perhaps marked by a cairn or trig point, which sits at the height of a munro. Must be present at a maximum stationery point
	- Graham: Graham
	- Cairn: A cairn marking a significant point on a land mass. These may be at the height of a Munro or Corbett but not considered a `top' if present at an increasing stationary point (point of inflection)

*Note that stand-alone Grahams (that is, land masses where Grahams have the greatest prominence) are not included here. Only Grahams which are part of land masses dominated by Munros and Corbetts are included. Sub2000s and Donalds are not included at all as they are not real hills.*
