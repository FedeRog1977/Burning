* Math
	- too lengthy to calculate the score of each of the four route elements based on individual values of the 5, 4, 11 and 20 elements respectively using the factorial method, so the latter 3 are calculated simply by volume/variety. This does not accurately reflect the difficulty of terrain for example as a route with grass and concrete will be considered more difficult than a route with grade 3 slab, simply because it has one more element. In this context it doesn't matter too much as the math has been demonstrated successfully. It's simply an inaccurate indicator.. for now.
	- when using the exhaustive method, volume is accounted for by the inclusion and exclusion of values which, if all-inclusive, should add up to N elements in that group. Bu this is rare.
	- the algorithm also does not exhaust all possible combinations of the elements of the `type' category. It only isolates them and accounts for any additional combinations such as [hillwalk, ridgewalk], [hillwalk, scramble], [hillwalk, scramble, climb].
	- further, it doesn't exhaust stages, it simply includes all stand-alone and relevant combinations: [walk-in, approach, on-hill, walk-out], [walk-in, on-hill, walk-out], [approach, on-hill], [approach, on-hill, walk-out]
	- terrain types aren't exhausted and also include no isolation examination, just all the possible combinations: [road, path], [road, farm path, footpath erosion], [road, path, footpath erosion], [road, forestry commission road, off-road, path, footpath erosion], [road, off-road, path, footpath erosion], [road, farm path, path, footpath erosion], [path, footpath erosion], [path, footpath erosion, off-path], [forestry commission road, path], [farm path, path, footpath erosion]
	- terrain difficulty is also not exhausted, nor does it include isolated examination, just the possible combinations: [concrete, stone staircase, broken rock, rocky talus, crag, smooth slab], [concrete, grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock, crag, rocky talus, talus (coarse scree)], [concrete, grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock], [concrete, grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock, rocky talus, talus (coarse scree)], [concrete, grass, grass with scattered rock, rocky talus, talus (coarse scree)], [concrete, grass, grass with scattered rock], [concrete, grass, grass with scattered rock, rocky talus], [concrete, grass, grass with scattered rock, rocky talus, talus (coarse scree)], [concrete, grass, broken rock, talus (coarse scree)], [concrete, grass, broken rock, rocky talus, talus (coarse scree), crag, notched slab], [concrete, grass, broken rock, talus (coarse scree), crag (grade 1 (easy)), notched slab (grade 1 (easy))], [grass, grass with scattered rock], [grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock], [grass, grass with scattered rock], [grass, broken rock, rocky talus], [grass, broken rock, crag], [grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock, crag], [grass, broken rock, crag, notched slab], [grass, stone staircase, notched slab], [grass, broken rock, rocky talus, notched slab], [grass, broken rock, rocky talus, scree (fine scree), crag (grade 2 (moderate)), notched slab (grade 2 (moderate))], [grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock, scree (fine scree), crag (grade 2 (moderate)), notched slab (grade 2 (moderate))], [grass, broken rock, grass with scattered rock, rocky talus]
