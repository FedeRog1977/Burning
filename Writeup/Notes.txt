Some Descriptions

* Region: Major Region
* Subregion: Mountain Region / Parent Mountain Range
* Land Mass Type: Mountain / Mountain Range / Stand Alone
        - Mountain: One land mass containing multiple hills (Munro/Corbett) and tops. To be included in a mountain, Munros, Corbetts, tops and cairns must be present before any contour declines
to under 600m
        - Mountain Range: Range of land masses containing multiple hills (Munro/Corbett) and tops. To be included in a mountain range, Munros, Corbetts, tops and cairns must be present before an
y contour declines to under 400m
        - Stand Alone: One land mass containing one hill (Munro/Corbett) but unlimited tops. Stand Alones with only a top or a carin marking their summit (not a Munro/Corbett) are not included
* Hill Type: Munro / Munro Top / Corbett / Corbett Top / Graham / Cairn
        - Munro: Munro
        - Munro Top: A peak, perhaps marked by a cairn or trig point, which sits at the height of a munro. Must be present at a maximum stationery point
        - Corbett: Corbett
        - Corbett Top: A peak, perhaps marked by a cairn or trig point, which sits at the height of a munro. Must be present at a maximum stationery point
        - Graham: Graham
        - Cairn: A cairn marking a significant point on a land mass. These may be at the height of a Munro or Corbett but not considered a `top' if present at an increasing stationary point (point of inflection)

Crampons

Crampons - Purposes (from Basic to Advanced)

1) Prolong the life of a boot/shoe's sole
2) Provide greater traction on slippery and/or greasy surfaces
3) Provide greater inserts upon certain rock faces and cracks etc.
4) Provide greater (horizontal movement) traction on loose snow or very thin fresh/urban ice
5) Provide greater (semi-vertical movement) traction on more compact snow in gullies etc.
6) Provide greater (horizontal movement) traction across very compact snow/ice
7) Provide greater (vertical movement) traction and climbing ability on solid ice

Crampons - Types

Snow Grips:
        - Small chains to assist with every day urban tasks when the weather is more challenging
        - (1), (2)
Micro Crampons:
        - Small spikes to assist with minor snow fall and thin ice in more urban environments, or on easy winter routes
        - (1), (2), (4)
C1 (Flexible):
        - Designed to be flexible and have points which can easily fit into varying sizes and shapes of cracks on dry slab etc.
        - Horizontal front spikes
        - 6-10 overall spikes
        - (1), (2), (3), (4)
C2 (Semi-Rigid):
        - A general winter mountaineering crampon for light snow activities but will most likely not support the user upon vertical climbs or ice climbs
        - Semi-horizontal (if existent) and vertical front spikes
        - 10-12 overall spikes
        - (1), (2), (4), (5), (6)
C3 (Rigid):
        - Designed to be as stirdy as possible. Often have snow repelling features such as anti-balling plates made from ABS plastic to stop snow building up on the shoe sole adn in the crampon
base
        - Horizontal and vertical, or adjustable front spikes. Some may be modular/removable
        - 10-12 overall spikes
        - (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7)

Crampons - Dangers

* Shoes too flexible for crampons: crampons can break apart or be destroyed
* Crampons too flexible for boots: loss of grip on appropriate surface (for boot) leading to injury or death
* Crampons too big for boots: crampons may uptrurn on boots leading to an ankle injury or stabbing
* Crampons with adjustable or removable spikes may disperse while in use as they are less durable and thus, cause injury

Boots

Boots - Types

* B0:
        - City, Running, Fell Running, Approach, Climbing, etc.
        - General walking or hiking boots/shoes, not designed for winter use. Usually soft leather or fabric
        - [Snow Grips], [Micro Crampons]
* B1 (Flexible):
        - Flexible hiking boots with some support such as ankle and heel
        - [Snow Grips], [Micro Crampons], [C1]
* B2 (Semi-Rigid):
        - Semi-rigid boots with stirdy ankle, heel and sole support. Usually intended for more advanced summer routes and low-level winter snow routes. Not ice climbs
        - [C1], [C2]
* B3 (Rigid):
        - Rigid boots with stirdy ankle, heel and sole support. Designed for Alpine hiking and climbing. Also suitable for ice climbing. Often made from tough leather or plastic and do not gener
ally bend. Usually have enforced soles and toe caps. Often equipped with more advanced insulation
        - [C1], [C2], [C3]
