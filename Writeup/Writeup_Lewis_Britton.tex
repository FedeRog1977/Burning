	This document’s presentation reflects the use of {\LaTeX} typesetting (Figure B7), using Computer Modern Unicode (Figure B8) (I haven't reached my GNU Troff phase yet). This escapes the inane formatting requirements of my institution. References are presented using \textsc{Bib}{\TeX}, favouring \textsl{oblique} over \textit{italic}, in-line with Donald E. Knuth’s preference (Knuth, 2020). The process is executed in command line using Vim, which is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to explain in a tutor such as this. For maximum optical pleasure, the use of M$\mu$PDF is vigorously advised with [-I]. Navigate this document using h($\leftarrow$), j($\downarrow$), k($\uparrow$), l($\rightarrow$), ensuring that the Caps-Lock, Super-Key `mod', or any other command key is not depressed. Note that the Oxford Serial Comma is favoured throughout this text. This study's sentence structure focuses on pragmatics and syntax, disregarding bloated filler content. Arguments are coherent, logical, definitive and straight-to-the-point. Nugatory theory is ignored. If you are curious about any of the mathematical, operational, logical, etc., symbols or notation used in this report, a comprehensive {\LaTeX}-syntax-based symbolist will be available from my \href{http://lewisbritton.com/Library.html}{website library} from approximately summer 2021.\\
 
	The word count of this piece reflects relevant content from titles, heading classes 1, 2 and 3, paragraphs, footnotes, tables (excluding [results] tables 4.7, 5.10 $\rightarrow$ 5.20), table titles, figures, and figure titles in \textit{Chapters 1 $\rightarrow$ 6}. Word count excludes any pre/succeeding content from \textit{Abstract}, \textit{Declaration \& Information}, \textit{Acknowledgements}, \textit{Table of Contents}, \textit{Appendices}, and \textit{Bibliography}.\\

	\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my dissertation supervisor, Dr Devraj Basu, for his approach with regards belief that students must be self-disciplined, organised, structured and punctual to their own degree. This closely relates to my own personally practiced work ethic and philosophy of the ASAP standard.\\

I would like to give credit for the computational aspect of this study to one of my biggest inspirations, John ``The Tzar'' Kelly. He inspired my love for everything barebones computational, from simple arrays (of hope), through Hyperthreading-enabled, all the way to x86 Assembly. I would also like to accredit Luke Smith for the foundation of my knowledge of Bram Moolenaar’s Vim and {\LaTeX}. This study’s presentation would not have optimal without Smith (2015).\\

This piece would not have been as efficient without the aid of the only acceptable Linux distribution, `distro’ if you will, Arch Linux. I would like to thank Judd Vinet for his eye-opening and life-altering contribution to the development and computer-system enthusiast community. ‘The Arch Principal’ is certainly out in high force. Finally, for making use of this software mechanically efficient, I would like to thank IBM for the creation of the ThinkPad T23, X30, T42, R50e, T60, X60, X200, X220 and T420 neoVimPads, the UltraDock, and the 1987 Model M \textit{Catastrophically Buckling Compression Column Switch and Actuator} typehorse (US369 9296A, 1972). For your convenience, one of my \href{http://lewisbritton.com/Blog/ThinkFlow.html}{blog posts} can satisfy your interest in this.

		\subsubsection*{Author's Note}

			\textit{The following content is manufactured by myself in aid of basic understanding of the background to contexts, data and methods present within this study. It is presented as teaching material, in a format I would output if in such position.}
		\subsubsection*{Figure B1: Linguistics of `{\LaTeX}'}

		{\LaTeX} (or LaTeX, even latex (Donald E. Knuth's more recent installment of {\TeX})) is usually pronounced /la\textlengthmark t$\varepsilon$k/ (`lah') or /le\textsc{i}t$\varepsilon$k/ (`lei'/`lay') in English (that is, not with the /ks/ pronunciation English speakers normally associate with X, but with a /k/). The characters T, E, X in the name come from capital Greek letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as the name of {\TeX} derives from the Greek: $\tau\varepsilon\chi\nu\eta$ (skill, art, technique, precision); for this reason, Donald E. Knuth promotes a pronunciation of /t$\varepsilon$k/ (tekh) (that is, with a voiceless velar fricative as in Modern Greek, similar to the last sound of the German word ``Bach", the Spanish ``j" sound, or as ``ch'' in a Scottish `loch').

		\subsubsection*{Figure B3: Why My Pre-Title’s Right and You’re Wrong}

		I have received numerous comments which anyone would regard na\"{i}ve and under-educated regarding my pre-title of this study: \textit{AG436 Dissertation Coursework Assignment}. The argument originates in the `Coursework Assignment’ portion. People argue that a dissertation `is not’/`does not have’ an assignment. Not only is this poor characteristic recognition, it is semantically wrong. \textit{AG436: Dissertation} is a class just like any other. However under this class, there are no lectures, no tutorials and therefore no exams as there is no [taught] content. Do not confuse this with the class `having no content’ though. AG436’s content is apparent through literature of the student’s choice. Therefore, it is possible for a `coursework assignment’ to be based on this. Hence, any further comments are null.
