The system featured in this project is a functional GPS web application which is designed to provide users with detailed information, guidance and recommendations surrounding sport and leisure in the fine Scottish Highlands and rural outdoors. The purpose of the application is primarily to allow users to plan and record their progress and grow their abilities in the hills using a variety of their own inputs (attributes), a weather forecasting system (Open Weather API), location services (Geolocation), Ordnance Survey mapping (OS API), route and attribute analytics, and informative material (keys and suggested readings). The system will be supported by JSON data files and a back-end database.
